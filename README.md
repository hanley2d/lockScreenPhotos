# lockScreenPhotos
When you log on to Windows the lock screen displays often nice images that are not easily found. When you do find them, they are also in a format that can't be viewed. 
This is a simple nodejs script that copies hidden files that appear on Windows locks screen into a directory so that they can be easily accessed.
